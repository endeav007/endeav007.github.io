            </ul>

            <p> Esports has been a huge part of my life since I first started at the University of Idaho. I was given the chance to
                work on their production team as a shoutcaster, as well as being a tournament organizer for their weekly Smash Ultimate Tournaments.
                In 2024, I transitioned to the media and graphics team, and fought for the separation of general media (youtube videos, posters, stream graphics)
                as social media. The director gave me a chance and I created myself a position as the social media team lead. During my time in this role, 
                I established the structure for how our socials needed to look and started a consistent posting strategy, increasing our engagement.   
            </p>

            <p>
                For the upcoming semester, I'm transitioning into a more techincal role, helping our broadcast team set up custom scripts for vMix. 
                I'm also going to be working on our website and possibly helping with making programs for our lighting set ups.

            <h2> iD Tech Camps </h2>
            <h3> Skills Gained: </h3>
             <p > May 2025 - August 2025 </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Student Mentorship </li>

            </ul>

            <p> 
                Working with iD Tech was a blast and helped me learn more about working as management for a team. I led 12 instructors
                each week, helping them prep cirriculum and prepare for the upcoming weeks. Every session had a new set of students
                with different needs and goals, so being flexible was a huge aspect of the job. Being a lead instructor was a great summer job, 
                and I learned a lot more about management and leading a team.

            <h2> Coding 4 Youth </h2>
            <p > March 2024 - April 2025 </p>
            <h3> Skills Gained: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Remote Work </li>
                <li> Collaborative Coding </li>
                <li> Self Management </li>
                
            </ul>

            <p> 
                Coding 4 Youth taught me a lot about time management and self pacing. I worked remotely and very independently. I had to learn 
                how to communicate with parents, develop custom cirriculum, and manage my classrooms all on my own. My manager gave me the space
                to learn and develop my skills independently.
