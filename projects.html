                <h3> Technologies used: Unreal Engine, 3ds Max, Blender </h3>
                <p> 
                    This project was the culmination of a 4-week-long exploration in game design with Unreal Engine. I had previous experience with smaller projects in Unreal,
                    but this was the first game I fully made using the engine. The goal of the project was to create a fetch quest, where a character has to bring an object from
                    point A to point B.  
                </p>

                <p> 
                    My instructor for the class helped with the blueprinting for picking up the object, but I took the assignment a step further and 
                    added the dialogue boxes to prompt the user, as well as blueprinting Jason, and the axe making the log disappear. Since I have a 
                    background in programming, blueprinting was a lot easier for me to get a hang of so I put a lot of my focus into that. I'm currently
                    working on redoing some of the assets for this game and redoing the lighting and environment as well, since I didn't get a lot of time 
                    to work on it.

                <h1> Fantasy Character Personality Quiz </h1>
                <h2> March 2025 - Present </h2>
                <h3> Technologies used: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Visual Studio Code </h3>


                <p>
                    This project is a personality quiz in the style of a 'choose your own adventure' game. The project has evolved a lot since I first started working
                    on it, and its turned into more of a story. It explores the meaning of living, and how we can learn a lot about people without even knowing their full
                    story or even their name. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, I'm working on handling the data passed by the user. I created an object that holds each question, answer, and what answer 
                    Each of the user's answers are held in an array, and my next step will be calculating the results and using them to give the player their
                    fantasy character. I still need to edit the results screen, so I haven't implemented it yet. I also want to redesign the quiz layout to 
                    make it look more like an old book.
